Notes about my code:

-Passed all given test cases.
-Used a linked list to store fileNames and keyWord occurances.
-Used access() function to check if the file exists before the use of realpath function.
-Read the complete file into the memory.
-Used strstr() for search.
-Wrote my own sorting algorithm
